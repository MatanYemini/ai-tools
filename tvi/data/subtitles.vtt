00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.200
So it's perfect. Thank you, Shikita.

00:00:18.0 --> 00:00:19.0
Hmm.

00:00:19.0 --> 00:00:20.0
Has your new house.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
It's good.

00:00:24.0 --> 00:00:29.880
It's still still growing into it a little bit. You know, got projects all over the place.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
But overall it's going really good.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
This is a real background, right?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.200
This is something else that up.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
Yeah, be uh

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Sorry. I was gonna say the thing that I, um,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.320
the software I use to record my podcast doesn't let you put a fake background

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.120
or do anything to your background.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.280
So I kind of had to do something pretty quickly.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.680
Good amount of reach in.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.880
I'm going to need to get this practice putting up your slide.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.200
Like Jody just ran to the restroom, which is going to be back.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.80
I'm, I'm here now. Sorry.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.40
I'm going to request to raise your hand and then, um, if you want to start

00:01:14.40 --> 00:01:17.40
Sharing your slides, your one all done.

00:01:17.40 --> 00:01:18.40
Raise my hand.

00:01:18.40 --> 00:01:19.40
Yeah.

00:01:19.40 --> 00:01:20.40
Present.

00:01:20.40 --> 00:01:22.40
Share screen with room.

00:01:22.40 --> 00:01:23.40
Mm hmm.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.380
higher screen, that one there.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.40
Ta-da!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.320
Looks good. Awesome. Is there, there's no sound in your presentation, correct?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.400
Um, no. Okay. There's not. There's a lot of thinking there, so I was making sure that that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.800
stayed the correct answer. Yeah. Um, we're about two minutes from the session start. So if it's

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.80
okay with you now that you're on the podium and we see your slides, I'll go ahead and allow

00:02:00.80 --> 00:02:04.640
participants in and then I have your repoles ready to come up.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280
Excellent. And so as those come up,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.680
because it's just a slide that's like it's pull time,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.400
you have to do something,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.320
you like click something so that the results pop up, right?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.880
I do, yes.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.960
Do I have to stop sharing for that to come up?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.480
No, you're not. Okay. Great.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.300
It activates it and then you, as soon as I close it,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140
it goes right back to your presentation for them.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.980
So, nice and easy.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.740
Easy.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.60
All right, people should be joining the session momentarily.

00:02:44.60 --> 00:02:44.900
Awesome.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.740
Is this closing out today, Alexandria?

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.980
There's one more like closing thing after this.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.820
Is that right?

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.900
do a community reflection.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.900
Awesome.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.100
I was gonna say we have a slightly smaller crowd right now.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.780
I know people have been joining internationally.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.980
So.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.340
Gets a little hard then.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.860
Yeah, crazy time zones.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.780
Yeah, for sure.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
Those crazy time zones.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.720
All right, well, it looks like we're at the 335 mark if you want to go ahead and get started.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.920
We'll head it over to you. Okay, thank you so much, Jody. Hello, everybody.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.0
Really excited to be chatting with you today to kind of as the last main session of this first

00:03:54.0 --> 00:03:58.400
day of the intensive, which is really exciting. I was so excited when ATD approached me to talk

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.840
about this. We're going to be talking about generative AI specifically in how you can use it to improve

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.200
video creation. I myself am a person who does a lot of video in my training and I'm coming to

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.360
rely more and more and I'm really excited about the future of generative AI when it comes to what

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.680
it can do for video. So I'm excited that you all are sticking with us through the end of today. I'll

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.360
do a brief introduction of myself and then we're going to get into some polls, some breakout sessions.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.760
we're going to do a whole bunch of stuff as we go through.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.120
Lots of interaction. Sounds like you've already had a lot of interaction.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.0
You're going to just keep on this theme of getting to use a lot of these polls.

00:04:44.0 --> 00:04:49.600
So for anybody who has never met me before, my name is Matt Jertsen.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.560
I am the founder of a company called Better Everyday Studios,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.800
where we are a leadership development firm, where we go into companies and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.560
and help them build custom, facilitate off-shelf workshops

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.760
to improve mainly their frontline leaders.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.880
I'm also the host of a podcast called

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.480
the Leadership Launchpad,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.360
where really what I'm doing with both

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360
better of any studios and the Leadership Launchpad

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.720
is taking all the lessons learned about leadership

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.80
from the experiences that I've had with my career

00:05:18.80 --> 00:05:21.400
and help companies make high-performing teams.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.680
So I started off my career as an instructor pilot

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.40
in the US Air Force for about a decade flying that big plane

00:05:28.40 --> 00:05:30.280
that you see on the screen, the KC-10.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.200
I then went to SpaceX and led the training development team

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.40
there.

00:05:34.40 --> 00:05:36.800
And so now that I'm out of my own,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.800
it's really interesting the timing of this whole AI boom

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.680
because it happened just as I went out on my own,

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.280
which was great for me because now that I'm by myself,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.480
it's like, I really got to worry about efficiency.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.640
I really got to worry about how can I get the most

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:00.40
of multiplying kind of my own efforts and the little efforts that I get from the people that I

00:06:00.40 --> 00:06:07.80
that I contract with and hired to support me. So it's been a lot of fun to just kind of watch

00:06:07.80 --> 00:06:14.680
all of this all of this go. So like I said, we use a lot of video in our training mainly in the

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:22.200
form of kind of showcasing little scenarios. We rarely make entire long videos, like the whole

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.720
training is just one long video, but we will use videos to highlight, you know, to introduce

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.80
a little bit of a topic or introduce, you know, a leadership scenario that people can then,

00:06:33.80 --> 00:06:39.160
can then comment on. And so for those kinds of situations, those kinds of use cases,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:46.280
I think AI is incredibly effective already, and it's only going to continue to get more

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.720
effective. So that's, that's my kind of background and what I've been doing. I would love to take

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.440
a minute right now, maybe you all have have done a bit of this already. I'd love to spend a minute

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:09.400
to get to know your experiences first with video and then also with AI specifically. So

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.280
Jody, if you could launch the first poll question, the question is simply how do you currently use

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.80
video for training purposes, if at all. And there's kind of, there's kind of a spectrum here from,

00:07:21.80 --> 00:07:28.680
I don't currently use video all the way through, you know, we kind of use it for everything. So

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.680
this is awesome. We're getting all kinds of stuff. So a small sliver of you still aren't using video

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.160
much. And then there's kind of a widespread of using it for a lot of different purposes. Yeah,

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.560
not a lot, the minority of talking head videos, I think that's expected tons of process,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.960
workplace procedure videos. I think that's one of the best ways to use it.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:56.120
Recorded webinars are a big one. Awesome. These are, okay, so this gives us a good sense

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.560
of how you are using it. Sounds like there's a big, a broad mix of all of these uses. That's

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:09.240
awesome. Okay, so then let's go to the second question. What is your personal role in creating

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.360
these videos? Because I know we have a big mix. So, you know, this again is kind of a spectrum from,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.480
You know, you personally create them all the way to,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.80
we just purchased stuff off the shelf,

00:08:21.80 --> 00:08:23.480
because I'd love to see kind of where we're at there.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.580
So a bunch of you, so we got like a bunch of you

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.880
personally are creating them,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.520
a bunch of them your team is creating them,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.200
which means you're interfacing with it regularly.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.680
And then a very small minority for outsourcing,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.280
purchasing off the shelf, this is awesome.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.760
So this is exactly the kind of crowd that I was hoping for.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.720
Sounds like you all have a lot of experience

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.800
with this kind of stuff.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.840
And so I'm sure we will get,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.480
you'll get just a lot more experience here today.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.360
So this is gonna be perfect for y'all.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.200
Excellent.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.960
And now let's go to question three.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.360
How much are you currently using AI?

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.160
kind of in general.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.520
And you've already answered this question before,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.280
but just generally how much are you currently using AI

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.400
kind of in your processes?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.160
So everything from you never touch it all the way

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.720
to deeply integrated into your work environment.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.120
Okay, so we got a minority, you've never touched it.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.200
Bunch people use it a few times.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.200
I'm, I personally am probably now getting

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.400
into the daily usage, that's kind of where I'm at here.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.440
And then yeah, the deeply integrated with daily work,

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.40
that's probably aspirational

00:09:26.40 --> 00:09:28.200
for just about every organization out there.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.600
So it makes sense that that would be kind of a minority.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.720
Awesome, that's super helpful context for me.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.520
And that's great because I think the presentation today,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.40
it sounds like is really tailored well

00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:43.800
for this audience in the sense that the majority of you

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.120
are at least doing some work with video

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.40
to quite a bit of work with video.

00:09:49.40 --> 00:09:51.160
You are doing it yourselves personally

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.120
or directly with your team.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.960
And you have some familiarity with AI tools,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.300
which that's perfect because what we're gonna be doing today

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.300
is we're just going to kind of look at the spectrum of uses

00:10:05.80 --> 00:10:07.380
in terms of how you can use AI

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.460
to help with your video creation,

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.180
have a little bit of a discussion in terms of,

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.180
how effective or how ready they are for prime time, if you will.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.420
And then we will, looking at one of the use cases

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.340
that is the most ready for prime time,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.820
give you a bunch of hands-on experience at your tables,

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.540
really playing around with all this stuff.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.580
So since you're gonna be doing some work at your tables,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.740
especially for the whole second half,

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.100
I would love to take you all to take a minute

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.260
to introduce yourselves at your table.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.980
And so at your table, let me reshare my screen here.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.200
Matt, do you mind coming back on the podium real quick? It looks like

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:56.640
being down. Yeah, we came down for a second. I think when I put people into their new tables.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.640
So, God, okay, perfect. So now I'm on the podium again. I'm sharing my screen again.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.960
Let me bring it up really quick. Yep. There we go. And so when you go to your tables,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.0
what I want you to do as a way to introduce yourself is to just quickly give name, role,

00:11:16.0 --> 00:11:20.860
and then what do you most wish AI could do for you?

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.680
And let's keep it in the realm of video creations.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.400
As most of you are in some way interfacing

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.320
or using video in your training.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.280
Think back to how you're using it right now

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.360
and what is something that if AI could do it,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.200
it would make your life a whole lot better.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.120
So we're just gonna do, you know,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.720
five or 10 minutes to give you a chance

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.680
to introduce yourselves.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.560
And then when you come back,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.680
I'd love to ask for some people to raise your hands

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.640
and give some interesting answers,

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.120
or if there's any common answers

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.600
or just most interesting answers.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.360
So we can kind of add a level set of,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.440
these are the problems that if AI could solve them,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.200
it would really make it a lot easier

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.320
for me to use video in my opinion.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.840
Okay, so let's...

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.280
All right, everyone, I'm going to put you into your tables.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.240
So I'm going to click a button called table mode.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.240
You are going to kind of have your view redirected to the people that are currently at your table.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.120
And you'll be able to talk and we won't be able to hear you in the main room,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.600
but you'll be able to talk to each other and you'll be able to hear Matt still.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.400
So I'm going to go ahead and turn that mode on.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.360
So you should now be able to see and hear your table mates

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.600
and you could always go back and click on the room share

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.880
option at the top of the gallery

00:12:40.40 --> 00:12:42.340
to see the slides and the question prompts.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.700
Hey, I'm a table person.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.940
All right, everyone, we're gonna start sending you back

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.340
into the main gallery.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.820
One moment and you'll see that you are back in the main room.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.600
Thank you.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:35.280
And then, Matt, when you're ready, you'll join the top and everyone who, now that you're

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.720
back in the main room, go ahead and mute your mic so that we can continue.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:48.900
Yeah, so I jumped into a couple tables and heard a bit of discussion there and there was obviously a bunch coming into the main chat as well.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:20:05.900
Any I would love it if anybody wants to raise their hand and either share one of the problems that they had or if they if there was some commonalities that came out of out of their discussions as to if you could get AI to solve one problem what would it be to help you with video creation.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.300
Do you want to start with Patricia?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.0
Right, can you hear me?

00:20:16.0 --> 00:20:17.300
We can.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.600
Great.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.800
One of the things we talked about was we'd love it if AI could

00:20:24.0 --> 00:20:30.640
do something with the repetitive tasks that we have to do in video creation, like masking

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.800
customer data. Somebody, I can't remember who it was, but...

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.640
Somebody talked about that specifically.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.620
Yeah.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.700
And things along that line.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.620
Yeah. Awesome. Yeah.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:51.20
I think that some of those video editing tasks definitely are super helpful.

00:20:51.20 --> 00:20:52.700
Thank you for that.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.740
Jess and then what did you have? One of the common ones that was mentioned at our table was

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:08.60
making edits to the video after it's been released like updates and edits like name changes of product

00:21:08.60 --> 00:21:14.620
or you know screenshots have changed or something like that. Being able to go in and find all of that

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.700
would be helpful. Yeah yeah or even I think in the in the best case

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:26.460
changing what people are set changing like the audio as well. There's nothing

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.300
worse. I don't know if I'm sure you've run into this where like you said like a

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.980
product name changes or just there's one term that changes and you have to

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.860
reshoot the whole video just because when all you want to do is go change that

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.340
little snip.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.500
Awesome. I think those are two really good use cases. Anybody else?

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.100
It's pretty good. Okay, I'll share my screen again. So I'm gonna

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.420
question down and join up.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800
Yeah, that's a good one.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:11.800
Yeah, that our group talked about, we wish AI could, well, the technology is getting better and be great if AI could express more human feelings and emotions, make it more real.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.800
Yeah, I think that's a good one.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.280
Just for everyone, yeah, you've got a real human.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.400
Yeah, I like it. I like it. Excellent.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.400
Jan, what did you have?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.400
Sure. We had a lot of great ones.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:35.400
Some of the things we talked about was a desire to get some good analytics where folks kind of like zoning out or tuning out in the video.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:42.400
And to that end, taking some of those longer videos, being able to segment them into more bite size pieces.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.400
maybe even start to as content is being discussed,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.40
maybe being able to even link to associated resources

00:22:52.40 --> 00:22:54.600
or make recommendations about how we can

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.880
incorporate some interaction

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.760
or some knowledge checks along the way.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.380
I love it, I love it.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.80
So some of these, these are all great challenges

00:23:05.80 --> 00:23:05.920
that people are facing.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.680
I think we can all say that we have faced

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.600
and we are facing when it comes to creating videos.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:16.600
And the neat thing is, is so along with some of the resources that were provided as part of the intensive,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:22.600
I provided kind of a big list of a bunch of different resources out there in tools regarding AI.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:29.600
The challenging part obviously with all things AI is that by the time you write a list of tools, they're all obsolete, or they all have new tools.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:38.600
But with some of these problems, there's already some really good tools out there that can potentially address some of the things that you're mentioning.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
We'll get into that in a minute.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.520
But the first thing that I want to do is just to set the stage,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.520
many of you may have already have seen this.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.960
But I want to give an example of what the potential may be

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.520
for the future of video when it comes to AI.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:58.800
Many of you have probably heard of Sora.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.80
This is not a product that is available to the masses yet,

00:24:02.80 --> 00:24:04.280
but this is from OpenAI.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.920
And it is their text to video creator.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.600
And I just want to show a couple quick examples of it.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.480
So what you're going to see is your screens.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.160
Yeah.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.960
We just want to make sure you share your screen.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.440
We interrupted when the questions come up.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.80
So we're not seeing it right now.

00:24:18.80 --> 00:24:19.200
OK, it goes away.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.840
OK, I will bring it back up then.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.380
So what you're going to see is a series of, you know, texts like this.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:31.340
This is the text prompt that they fed into Sora and then it'll jump to the video.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.0
So I'll let this play for a little bit.

00:24:33.0 --> 00:24:37.680
So a cartoon, kangaroo, disco, dances and what came out of it.

00:24:39.0 --> 00:24:45.800
is this, you know, so what you, you know, pretty good, pretty life-like, or in terms of what you

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.520
would expect from a high quality, not life-like, obviously, but from a high quality graphic designer.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:57.80
This is maybe like the cutest thing that you could ever imagine. A couple of the movements

00:24:57.80 --> 00:25:02.120
clearly look a little funny where their snouts are moving around, but I mean, wow, with all that

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:08.600
hair and the snow feels like it's moving really naturally. I think this is a really good

00:25:09.0 --> 00:25:17.80
example. The one after this, I think this one's one of the better ones. The monkeys in the background

00:25:17.80 --> 00:25:25.480
look a little funny, but the birds, the water all looks really good. This is a very detailed one.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.920
This is, I think, the best one there is. This looks like it could be B-roll shot from a drone,

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:38.280
right? Just looks really, really clear. And then the last one, sorry if it's choppy for some folks.

00:25:39.0 --> 00:25:41.0
The last one is

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:48.940
Also pretty good. This is the only one with the video when it pauses when you see it some of the some of the people look a little strange

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.160
When you're watching if you watch them walk sometimes hands disappear and stuff like that

00:25:54.360 --> 00:26:02.320
But so again, so this is Sora from OpenAI it is still a test product that you can't get to like researchers and stuff are using it

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.200
but overall

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.680
pretty impressive so

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:15.560
So the point of what I'm trying to say here, if I can get it to go to the next screen, is

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.560
it's all over, right?

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.560
You know, right?

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.200
Like, we're just going to use AI to create videos in the future and we're never going

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.960
to have to do anything ever again.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.800
That's obviously not the case.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.0
Not what any of us really think is going to happen.

00:26:30.0 --> 00:26:36.80
And I think there's some interesting reasons why though, like, this shot here, I think

00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:40.440
things like B-roll is gonna be really, really useful

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.160
in the near term, but in terms of creating

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.400
entire videos this way, there's clearly gonna be

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.720
a lot of limitations for quite a while.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.600
And most of that around editing it,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.0
because the thing is, some of the discussions

00:26:55.0 --> 00:26:57.880
have really probably gone a lot into

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.200
how AI is generating all this stuff.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.200
And the truth is, is that it's like the AI models themselves

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.880
don't necessarily have a firm grasp of what the things are that they are creating.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.800
And so let's say you loved this portion of the video, you loved everything about it,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.480
but you just wanted that little, like it looks kind of like a lighthouse,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.840
you just wanted that lighthouse to be like three stories instead of just kind of this one story.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:31.520
And you said, okay, make this exact same video, just make that lighthouse three stories tall.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:38.320
it's going to make an entirely new video and at least in the experimentation that I've done with images,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.120
it becomes progressively more difficult to make those small tweaks.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.120
And so because it doesn't even know that there is like a lighthouse there,

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120
it doesn't understand that that's like a thing that's on there.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.120
But anyway,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.280
really what we have when it comes to AI and video usages. I think we have a whole range of use cases

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:05.760
that are all on different levels of this spectrum. Everything from ready for prime time

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:12.640
and still experimental. And this is just purely based on my uses of it, of where I would put

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.240
things on this spectrum. Like obviously script creation, script editing, that's like really,

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:24.560
really ready right now. Like it sounds like a lot of the presentations have already been a bit about

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.120
you know getting in, working with scripts, working with writing, using the different tools like

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.240
clod to write things for you. That's something that's totally ready right now. They can really speed

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:41.200
up video creation and something that I'm using today. The next level up I would say would be

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:48.0
audio editing or even audio creation. Those two things are very different things. I think they're

00:28:48.0 --> 00:28:51.760
I don't know. I might have been a little bit generous of putting it this close to ready for

00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:00.0
prime time, but if any of you have used things tools like dscript where the premise or one of the

00:29:00.0 --> 00:29:05.440
big features that dscript says they offer is that you know you put in a video clip of you

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:13.680
an audio clip of you talking and it generates a script and you say I want to change this word

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:21.360
in here. As long as it has enough of you in there, enough of your voice as you know an example to

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:29.120
pull from, it can change that word and put it in your voice saying that word. So what should come

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:38.80
out of it is a seamless way to edit the audio in a video, you know the individual words without

00:29:38.80 --> 00:29:42.960
reshooting the audio, re-recording the audio or reshooting the video, which is pretty incredible.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.360
other tools that are ready today that are being used today are allowing you to shoot a video in

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:56.480
English and then they'll automatically change it all to a new language but still in your voice

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:03.520
which is pretty incredible. So those are things that, you know, again, some of these tools are in

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:11.120
that resource list that I provided. Next level up from that would be the video editing. And these

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.880
to audio and video editing that kind of interpose back and forth as to how ready they are for

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:19.680
prime time. One of the discussion, one of the things that a couple of you mentioned in terms of

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:27.840
the challenges that you're facing are things like, you know, taking longer form video and cutting

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:34.800
it down into smaller bite size chunks. With my podcast, I've been a big user of something

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.920
called Opus Clips. And again, there's many tools out there to do this, but Opus Clips is one where

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.560
where you feed in a long form video

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.720
and it scans through the whole thing

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.160
and pulls out individual clips that you can serve up

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.780
that are one minute long and a minute and a half long.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.80
So it can do a lot of that editing for you.

00:30:53.80 --> 00:30:57.740
Again, in terms of how I've seen it used,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.960
sometimes the clips are good,

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.40
sometimes they're not that good.

00:31:02.40 --> 00:31:04.920
So that's where it's still maybe a little bit more,

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.720
it's not fully ready for primetime.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.640
There's totally products out there, but not fully ready.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.320
Avatar creation is a big one.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.360
Tools like Cynthia can make those,

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.720
which are great for talking head videos,

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.640
if you can use those.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.360
And then things like Sora with the full video creation.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.680
And there are actually tools out there now

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.120
that maybe aren't gonna be giving the best stuff,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.680
but theoretically, where you can say,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.160
I want a 10 minute video on X topic.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.520
And it's gonna generate the script,

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.840
it's gonna generate the avatar,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.540
it's gonna generate images and emojis

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.680
that are gonna come over, it's gonna do the whole thing.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.280
Based on my experience,

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.880
like that's why it's like still on the still experimental phase,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.320
they're not that great yet,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.600
but they are available for use

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.560
and for you to start playing with

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.160
because they're obviously gonna get better.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.480
I love that folks have been sharing all these links

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.920
in tools that they have used

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.540
because yeah, HeyGen is a really good one.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:10.540
The Adobe Podcast is a really great one for cleaning up audio.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:22.40
If you have a background noise that you want to remove or just give your audio a little bit of a richer, deeper sound, the audio podcast tool is a really good one.

00:32:22.40 --> 00:32:24.40
So these are all great tools.

00:32:24.40 --> 00:32:26.540
So you can all see that there's tons of these out there.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.540
There's a big list that's in the resources that we sent out.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:33.40
And there's new ones every single day.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.200
Because there's this wide range and because there's a wide range of folks of how you have used it,

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:44.960
what I want to focus on for the second half of this session is on this script creation,

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.600
because I think that's the most ready for prime time.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.920
Let me keep going here.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.160
I'm going to skip over this one just for the sake of time.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.480
And so what I want to do, again, this

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.640
is going to be a group exercise that you

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.520
can do that will do at our tables.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.320
So we're going to give you about five minutes where

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.360
we're going to break up to tables again.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.0
Hopefully at your tables, at least one of you

00:33:10.0 --> 00:33:12.800
has access to some AI tool, whether it's

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.560
Claude or chat, GPT, Gemini, whatever it is.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.320
It doesn't matter the tool.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.680
And what I want you to do is to ask it to, you can start with this prompt, write a script for a

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.800
one-minute video on the importance of building trust on a team. That's obviously an extremely

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:36.80
rudimentary clips or rudimentary prompt. And please, what I want you to do is maybe start with that,

00:33:36.80 --> 00:33:39.920
but then please bring in some of the lessons that it sounds like you have already been covered by

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:46.0
Josh earlier on of how to make some improvements to that script. Just take five minutes, use one

00:33:46.0 --> 00:33:50.80
tool from your whole table because you can all work together and generate just like a

00:33:50.80 --> 00:33:54.800
one-minute script and then we can come back and I'd love to see when you come back, I would love

00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:01.920
to see what prompt you ended up with and then share kind of what you found or what was the result

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:08.400
of your prompt.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:13.900
Okay, so this is the chance for you in real time to take the lessons that you've already learned in this intensive session and put it to use right now. Okay, so Jodi, let's go to the tables.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:26.300
All right, I'm going to go ahead and move you guys to the table mode and Matt, you're currently at a table. So if you want to jump around, you're welcome to or you can move to a table alone. If you want to continue with instructions at the top of the screen.

00:34:27.60 --> 00:34:27.740
Perfect. Thank you.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.780
Okay, now be in your table.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.200
Hello.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.440
So our task is to create a video script.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.540
Do you have access?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800
So they don't want to.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.100
Peace.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.500
That's this opposite.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600
Yeah, I thought somebody was sharing their screen.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.200
And I'm happy to.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.100
There we go.

00:36:25.0 --> 00:36:27.0
Can you see my screen?

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.580
Sorry, you're trying to share into the main room.

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:32.620
Try to share into your table.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.780
Yeah, I'm sharing the screen with the table right now.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:40.740
Do you see it now?

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.680
I'm sure my screen can anyone can you see us?

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.400
Can you see now?

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.160
Somebody sharing and then stop sorry guys

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.620
So we have a group that keeps doing a room share over table, which is interrupting everyone

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.960
So we're just trying to make sure that you're I'm gonna come into the room. So one one more

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.300
Hey, Jody, if you can hear me, we can bring everybody back.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.380
Okay, we're going to go ahead and bring people back. So thank you everyone.

00:38:56.0 --> 00:39:02.160
Sounds like that was a bit crazy for some people, but it looks like a few groups were still able to get through it, which is great.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.720
Let's see. So

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:19.760
Yeah, so we got a couple good ones here. Hey, this you got you got one where you had a bright upbeat music plays the screen shows a diverse group people. I love. I love the thing that I find interesting when I have when I ask

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.680
um, chat GPT or whatever tool to write a script is that it writes a true script, right? Like it

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.120
usually gives you ideas for like what could be seen, what the visual could be, what the scenes

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:40.320
could be, and all that kind of stuff. And so anybody else want to kind of, anybody else get to a good

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.280
script, a good prompt in script that they want to share, we'll see if anybody was able to get through it.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:58.700
Craig, what did you all get? Yeah, so my team, we tried to follow the prompts that we learned earlier. So the prompt was act as an instructional designer.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:06.700
Please create a one minute video script on the importance of building trust as a team that video should be a conversation between two C suite executives.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.260
And so it describes the opening scene,

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.580
a modern executive office with a city-state view,

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.220
two executives, it gives us their name or seated

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.500
across from each other, engaged in a casual,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.980
yet post-focused conversation.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.780
And so I actually published it in,

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.860
I didn't, I'll put it in the,

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.340
I think I put it in the room chat.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.580
So it's in there somewhere.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:38.700
Awesome. How did you, what did you think of what you ended up getting? Any, any initial thoughts of the output?

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.700
It's been a little hectic, so I haven't really read through it much.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.700
Yeah.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:52.700
But yeah, I mean, I think it's great. I mean, obviously we'd probably do a little tweaking, but it's far better than I would have come up with on my own.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.700
Yeah, perfect. I think that's great.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.700
Okay. Anybody, anybody else have a good example? We would do one more.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.500
Maybe we can take the one that's in the chat from Jesus.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.740
What was your

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.140
is from the one that you shared in the chat.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:21.20
What was the prompt that you all used?

00:41:21.20 --> 00:41:22.380
I'm not sure if I saw that.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:32.400
We didn't get that far. We just did the initial prompt and then we were barely exploring

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:40.240
adding a role and in this case we were going to use video producer but then we were pulled back

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.880
into the main. Okay, and we had a lot of trouble with the sharing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.800
Okay, perfect. So then let's see what we can do. I'm going to pull some up rather than

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.360
So we're having a little bit of trouble with the full room.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.0
Let's see what we can do kind of with me sharing my screen

00:42:03.0 --> 00:42:06.960
using one of these tools.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.240
And see if we can do the next exercise kind of as a group

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.440
right here.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.440
So.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:32.100
What, so that first one, who wants, so I'm using this honestly for the very first time because X just released grok to and yesterday. And so I'm just playing around with it because it's kind of like the newest tool to give it a try.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:36.20
So I'd love for you all to give me what,

00:42:36.20 --> 00:42:38.780
based on the discussions of what Josh mentioned earlier,

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.340
what should we put in for a prompt, same kind of thing.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:44.100
One minute video about trust.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.140
Put a couple examples inside the chat

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.340
of what I should put in for the prompt here.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:55.660
Again, a bunch. Okay. First one from Cali. Let's see. Act like a learning

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.660
architecture and video producer write a video script for an instructional video on.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.500
Okay, so let's see if we can take this.

00:43:07.0 --> 00:43:08.280
play around with it here.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.120
We'll see what we get.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.620
So we're going to act like a learning architect

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.640
and video producer, write a video script

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.280
for an instructional video on.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:22.300
Let's say the importance of building trust on a team.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.660
Ensure the scripts are engaging concise in a line.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.780
And so this is definitely where we would want

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.980
to have specific learning objectives.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.740
But for conciseness sake, let's kind of trim this down.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.540
And I'm going to say, rather than write video script,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.980
I'm going to say write the voice over,

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.380
because I just want to see the voice over.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.360
for instructional video on the importance of building trust

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.360
that is one minute long and intended for a corporate audience.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.880
Let's see what this comes up with on here.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.800
Again, this just came out yesterday, first time using this.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.440
So let's see what it says.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.180
Okay, so it's still giving us some scenes,

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.320
but it's a lot of voice over,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.280
most of the voice over script is in here.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:12.140
Let's see.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:16.620
So I think, you know, I said corporate audience.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:19.740
The dynamic world of business, trust is the silent force

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.140
that powers collaboration, innovation, and success.

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.900
Already this feels super corporate,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.540
which is kind of exactly what we told it to do,

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.580
which is great.

00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.140
And just if you've never used GROC before,

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:35.220
one of the features that it does have

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.340
is you can turn fun mode on and off.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.180
I'm gonna leave it off

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.580
because I have no idea what it's gonna do

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:41.660
if you turn on fun mode.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.540
but I think that gets even wilder.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.80
So here we have a script.

00:44:48.80 --> 00:44:49.280
We had a basic thing.

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.80
Now what I think,

00:44:50.80 --> 00:44:52.360
because a lot of times maybe since,

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.920
as you've seen in all of these presentations already,

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.560
you have to be super careful

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.160
with how much you trust anything that comes out of AI.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.760
I think the last presenter put it perfectly where,

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.40
I treat these like a new intern or something,

00:45:08.40 --> 00:45:10.40
where they don't have a lot of context,

00:45:10.40 --> 00:45:11.360
they're trying their best,

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.120
but they get a lot of stuff wrong.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:17.520
And so already this has, you know,

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.840
this is sounding pretty corporate.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.520
This is sounding kind of dry.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.880
And sometimes maybe you are,

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.960
so because you're not super trusting

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.920
of what comes out of the AI,

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.800
maybe you, if it's a subject that requires a lot of expertise,

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.840
maybe you wanna start by, you know,

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.440
having a subject matter expert write a script for you,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.120
but then it comes out super dry.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.600
And so this is where I think AI can be really helpful

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.720
in editing scripts.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.280
So you take something like this and you say,

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.940
you wanna, okay, this is all great,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:49.880
but I don't want it to sound as corporatey.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.880
So what is,

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:58.320
how could I prompt this to maybe change this to,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.520
I don't know, make it less corporate or add a little humor?

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.560
I don't know, what are some things that we could add in,

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:05.400
you think?

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.120
But go ahead and put it in the chat.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.820
Use a relaxed tone. Okay, let's see. Let's see what comes out of fleet if I do that.

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:15.340
Bye.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:21.200
Want you to region rate that script.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.900
but in a more relaxed and informal.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.400
formal tone using plain language.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400
Let's see what happens if we do something like that.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.800
I'm not going to try on Fun Mode.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.960
I don't want to be responsible for what Fun Mode does.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.400
Ooh, Gen Z audience, that's a really good one.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.840
Okay, so now here it kind of went to the other extreme. Hey there, let's chat about something super

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:56.600
important for any team. Trust. Obviously completely different direction in terms of what it in terms

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:02.760
of what it said, but I think this starts to give you an idea of one of the best ways that I think,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:10.520
you know, 100% AI is ready to do prime time right now is start a, you know, a little bit of introducing

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.160
something, you know, you know, giving that first pass of topics, but then even more importantly,

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.120
playing with the topic, playing with what you wanted to say, giving you ideas of new directions

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:28.680
for it to go, right? So yeah, and already people are like, you know, use a Disney tone. I think

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.480
that would be great. Inspired by Little League Baseball. I think these are, yeah, so let's try

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.760
that one like write this script for

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:49.540
training coaches of little baseball. What comes up there?

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.340
So yeah, so it does a little bit.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.60
Hey, coaches, let's talk about something super important.

00:47:58.60 --> 00:48:00.420
So the nice thing about here is it's remembering

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.820
that relaxed tone, but just changing a bit of the language, right?

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:11.560
Okay, so quick example, I was hoping to do this in the breakout tables, but that didn't really work out. So that's okay.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:18.840
A few things that are coming up in here. Yeah, I think so Susan, when it suggests visual elements, is there an AI tool that would create the visual elements?

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:25.640
100% and in fact, many of these tools that you're using for this can create the video elements as well.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:34.120
So as an example, right here, let's say, what is this first one? Open shot, a group of kids playing baseball with coaches in the background.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.280
Let's take this and go.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:46.720
make an image of a group of kids playing baseball with coach in the background.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.80
Let's see what happens there.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:49:09.800
And many of these tools, you know, chat GPT does this, you know, there's lots of these tools that are able to do that right away. Obviously, this is creating stills. There are ones out there. So this, you could just create a still and you know, add some movement to the camera in the video editing software. So there's a little bit there 100%.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:19.800
Yeah, there's, there's, we're, you know, these, this chat is exactly highlighting all of the things that you need to be careful of when you're doing that.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:24.800
creating moving objects, that's where if you go back to thinking about that spectrum that we have,

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:30.800
where you're talking about making video, there are 100% R tools that will do that for you.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.800
I think they're still very experimental and not going to be making making a ton of great stuff for you.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:42.800
Okay, so we'll call that a good experiment there.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:47.800
So let's jump back to my screen share really quickly

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.640
to the slides just so we can finish this out.

00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.840
Thank you for rolling with me since the tables

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.820
wasn't working quite as we intended.

00:49:57.40 --> 00:49:59.680
But so if we kind of close out this

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.340
and then give you time for some questions at the end,

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.160
hopefully that gave you a really great example

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.800
of how you can adjust the prompt as you go through

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.600
to change the script, make it more fun,

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.160
they get sound like a celebrity, those kinds of things.

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:23.460
And to close out, you know, final thoughts, big picture of when I think about using generative AI

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:30.820
for creating videos for training purposes. Most of the tools, one first thing to note,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:36.500
most tools over promise initially, you know, the things that they show you are the best that has

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.20
ever been created using their tools. So just be prepared for that. That's something that actually

00:50:40.20 --> 00:50:48.420
has been a disappointment for me is that very often there's, I get really excited about a tool

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:53.540
and then it doesn't quite perform as much as I wanted to. So just be prepared for that.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:51:00.580
They eventually get really helpful once you learn the nuances of how to use them. I bet,

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:06.20
you know, a lot of that came out from Josh and then experimentation is really the only way to

00:51:06.20 --> 00:51:10.300
learn. And so getting into these tools, playing around, trying new things is how

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.60
you learn to use those individual tools, how you can incorporate them into your

00:51:14.60 --> 00:51:20.140
day-to-day workflow for creating these videos. So hopefully you found that

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:26.380
helpful. Kind of to close out, if you found this helpful, I'm gonna stop here

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:31.780
for a second and I'm answering questions, but just to give a quick plug, I do have

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.900
a newsletter that focuses on leadership development and some of these learning

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.940
development topics. Love for you all to join. Just one email a week, not a huge

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.300
lift for you. Other than that, I'll stop sharing and I would love to see if

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:50.660
there's any other questions that came up out of this.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.700
And we kind of closed out there really pretty fast.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:52:10.100
As regards to what is produced by AI, is there any such issue from ownership perspectives with the, you know, normally you have to get rights and permissions and all of that for pictures.

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.100
How does it work here?

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.760
Yeah, Josh kind of just answered that in the chat.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.40
There is a lot of gray area.

00:52:17.40 --> 00:52:19.680
First, in terms of like, there is no gray air in that you cannot

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.200
copyright this stuff for yourself.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.880
So what you create isn't now yours or your company's to own.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.120
I think, other than that, at least as far as I'm aware,

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.800
and anybody else can jump in, I think

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.880
there's a lot of space where there's

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.80
a lot of court cases going on right now

00:52:37.80 --> 00:52:42.280
in terms of what can be what's able to be used.

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:48.880
Most of the questions, most of the arguments are around using training data and, you know,

00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.880
some of these early tools that popped up, they just use the internet.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.680
They used YouTube.

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.980
They just trained on all this stuff.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.740
And so that's where all these authors have come forward and said, hey,

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:01.980
I never gave you the right to use my book for your data.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.480
And so the training data that's used is where a lot of this legal trouble has gotten into.

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.280
I think, at least in terms of what I've seen.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:21.600
A lot of the industry is starting to correct for that and making sure they are training on data that they have clear permission to use and that's going to clarify a lot of things.

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.880
But yeah, I think there's still a lot of unsolved questions with with this kind of stuff.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.720
And Lacey, for what about if your creating images in a license under Adobe Photoshop?

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:42.400
I think for any tool that you're using, you're going to want to read the terms and conditions

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:43.680
very closely to know that.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.360
Because yeah, if you're talking about like generative fill, I'm honestly not sure where

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:49.440
that fits in.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.700
What other questions do people have?

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:24.0
You know, Matt, I don't know if we have time for it, but I would love to know how to if you have any tips on getting consistent imagery. I shared an example earlier in the day where I wanted an image of a referee blowing this whistle and that came out fine eventually.

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:32.600
And then I and then I wanted that exact same referee holding his hands up like in a touchdown and it was just a disaster.

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:33.520
Yeah.

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:43.700
Yeah, I think and that kind of goes to what I was referencing before in terms of where the limitations for a lot of this stuff is because if you think about it.

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:48.700
For human beings language is an abstraction of reality.

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.700
Right, we live in reality, and we use language to describe it.

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.700
Whereas for these tools, language is the reality.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.700
they don't yet know that there is something else underneath it.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.700
And so, you know, to use the example from before about, you know,

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.700
I want to make the lighthouse three stories tall.

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:17.700
It just doesn't know that there is a thing called a lighthouse that is an object in there. It just sees this like array of pixels.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:30.180
And so that's where I think we are still pretty limited in our ability to do exactly what you just said. I do think they're getting better and the best thing that I have seen. And if anybody else can prompt this is

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:36.860
just the more and more precise you can be, you know, in these prompts. If you've looked up, you know,

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.860
you can go on YouTube and see some amazing

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:46.260
descriptions of how to do really good prompts that include like the type of camera to be used, the settings of that camera,

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:54.60
the lighting that's going to be used, the more specific you can get with that kind of stuff, the more consistent the output is going to be.

00:55:54.60 --> 00:56:10.60
But yeah, I don't yet have figured out a good way to do exactly what you just said because, again, when you say same coach, like, like that phrase doesn't mean anything to the AI at least as far as as I understand.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.580
That's not a great answer for you, but thank you nonetheless.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.640
Yeah.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.720
Yeah, and yeah, to that point that just got shared, there are like so many of these tools. And if you

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:38.0
think about it, especially with video, when it comes to all things training related, video is

00:56:38.0 --> 00:56:44.0
probably going to be at the forefront of all of these tools, because there's such a huge creator

00:56:44.0 --> 00:56:49.440
market out there, right? If you think of YouTube creators, there's so much money in that game,

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.520
that there's tons of tools being generated for YouTube creators. And those are the same kind of

00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:01.40
tools that we can piggyback on the top on the back of for what we're trying to do.

00:57:02.0 --> 00:57:07.360
And so that's kind of typically where I go to. If you're looking for what if you want to figure

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:12.240
out what's the latest and greatest in terms of AI tools for video creation, jump on YouTube

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:20.960
and ask there, you know, what are the top 10 tools for YouTubers today? Those kinds of questions will

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.440
usually get some good videos that are, you know, those videos are constantly

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.680
being turned out. Obviously, like all videos, some of them aren't that great.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:35.760
But that's how every six months or so I'll jump in and ask a question like that just to get a sense of what's out there.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.420
Did I miss anything in the chat?

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.140
Did I miss any questions in the chat?

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:16.900
Matt, I was going to ask you if you have a link to your newsletter that's not a QR code.

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:18.900
Simple to have QR code.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:25.700
there can't access them so just want to make sure we have that link if anyone is.

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.740
I know for this newsletter. Yeah I'll drop that link in there.

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:34.740
So yeah please I would love it. I would love love love it if you all let me change this to the room.

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:43.540
Here's the link to the newsletter and then also for anybody who hasn't seen me I'm super I'm always

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:49.220
on LinkedIn basically every day and so here's a link to my LinkedIn profile if you want to follow

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:53.60
me there and chat more there because I'm always, I love talking to people on LinkedIn. So you can

00:58:53.60 --> 00:58:53.780
find me there too.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:05.660
Cool. Yeah. So hopefully you found this helpful. Obviously, this is still a very big space. There's lots of stuff happening.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:21.960
Yeah, there's there's just the amount of tools that are being created constantly amaze me and so but I do think there's just a wide spectrum of what's ready to go right now, which is definitely anything script related is like ready to go.

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:27.260
Anything skit still image create is still image related is pretty ready to go.

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:32.540
Audio, editing and creation, there's a lot of good stuff out there.

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:36.800
The creation piece can still sound a little weird, but it's pretty good.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.500
Video editing in terms of taking longer form videos and cutting out,

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:46.340
you know, cutting out all the umbs and the us and cutting out the, you know,

00:59:46.340 --> 00:59:48.460
and finding great like one minute segments.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:49.940
There's a lot of good tools there.

00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:53.700
And then the video creation piece, we're still, we're right around the corner,

00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:58.700
but I'm not using any tools to create full video just yet.

01:00:01.0 --> 01:00:14.0
Awesome. Well, Jenny, sorry, we may have confused you with a video game. We weren't building actual video games. I'm glad everyone took a chance on this session. Thank you so much.

01:00:14.0 --> 01:00:24.0
We are going to take a really short brief five minute break before we come back for our last session with the amazing Myra Roldan.

01:00:24.0 --> 01:00:28.320
She is going to help us reflect and wrap up today.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.0
We want to make sure we're building in some of that very important reflection time.

01:00:34.0 --> 01:00:35.840
Thank you all.

01:00:39.0 --> 01:00:40.40
Thank you everyone.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.120
I want to go out and close our classroom.
